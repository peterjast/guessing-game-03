### Lab 2: User Stories
This is our first exposure to user stories. User stories are a device commonly used in software development to identify what the functionality and design of a product should be by considering the interests and motivations of people with varied multiple points of view. They are presented in the manner of

>As a __, I want __, so that __

This layout allows a client to communicate to a team what type of behavior they are looking for and allow the developer team to think up a solution that best fits the the clients need.

The development team will then create sub-bullets called Feature Tasks which are individual tasks that must be completed by the developer to accomplish the user story. Once all of the feature tasks for an individual user story is completed, so is the story.

### Lab 3

1. As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.
  * Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
  * Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML
1. As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.
  * Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
  * Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
  * It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
  * After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
1. As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.
  * Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
  * Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
  * The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
  * Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
  * Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
1. As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
  * Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
